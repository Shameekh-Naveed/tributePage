          <h2><span>About Itachi</span></h2>
          <p id="about">Itachi Uchiha (うちはイタチ, Uchiha Itachi) was a prodigy of
          Konohagakure's Uchiha clan and also served as an Anbu Captain. He
          later became an international criminal after murdering his entire
          clan, sparing only his younger brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined
          the international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose
          activity brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja
           — including Sasuke — who sought to avenge their clan by killing
          Itachi. Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more
           complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in
           the interest of his brother and village, remaining a loyal shinobi
            of Konohagakure to the very end. </p>
